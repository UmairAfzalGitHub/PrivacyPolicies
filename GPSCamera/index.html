    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <div class="date">February 21, 2026</div>

    <p>This privacy policy applies to the <strong>GPS Map Camera: Timestamps</strong> app (hereby referred to as "Application") for mobile devices that was created by <strong>Umair Afzal</strong> (hereby referred to as "Service Provider") as a Free service. This service is intended for use "AS IS".</p>

    <h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>
    <p>The Application is designed with your privacy in mind. We do not collect, store, or transmit any personal data to our servers or any third party. All features of the Application function entirely on your device.</p>

    <p><strong>Camera Access:</strong> The Application requires access to your device's camera solely to enable photo capture with GPS and timestamp overlays. Photos are saved directly to your device's local storage and are never uploaded or shared by the Application.</p>

    <p><strong>Location Access:</strong> The Application accesses your device's GPS location solely to embed location information onto photos as requested by you. Your location data is used in real time on-device only and is never collected, stored on our servers, or shared with any third party.</p>

    <h2>Data Storage and Sharing</h2>
    <p><strong>We do not save, collect, or share any user data with third parties, AI services, or any external systems.</strong> All photos, timestamps, and location data generated through the Application remain exclusively on your device. The Service Provider has no access to any content you create using this Application.</p>

    <h2>Third Party Access</h2>
    <p>The Service Provider does not share any user data with third parties. No personal information, photos, location data, or usage data is transmitted to external services. The Application does not integrate with any third-party data collection or analytics services.</p>

    <h2>Opt-Out Rights</h2>
    <p>You can stop all use of the Application by uninstalling it. Use the standard uninstall process on your mobile device or via the app store. You may also revoke camera or location permissions at any time through your device's settings, though this will disable the relevant features of the Application.</p>

    <h2>Data Retention Policy</h2>
    <p>The Service Provider does not retain any user data. All photos and associated metadata (timestamps, GPS coordinates) are stored solely on your device and remain under your full control. You may delete them at any time using your device's standard photo management tools. For any questions, please contact: <a href="mailto:Umairafzal10@yahoo.com">Umairafzal10@yahoo.com</a></p>

    <h2>Children</h2>
    <p>This Application is not intended for children under the age of 13. The Service Provider does not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13. If such information is discovered, it will be deleted promptly. Parents or guardians who become aware of their child's data being collected should contact the Service Provider.</p>

    <h2>Security</h2>
    <p>Because the Application does not transmit or store any user data externally, your photos and location information remain protected on your own device. The Service Provider encourages users to maintain device-level security measures such as screen locks and up-to-date operating systems to safeguard their data.</p>

    <h2>Changes</h2>
    <p>This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time. You are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. Continued use of the Application implies your acceptance of the updated terms.</p>

    <h2>Your Consent</h2>
    <p>By using the Application, you consent to the use of your device's camera and GPS as outlined in this policy, with the understanding that no data is collected, stored, or shared externally by the Application.</p>

    <h2>Contact Us</h2>
    <p>If you have any questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy, contact: <a href="mailto:Umairafzal10@yahoo.com">Umairafzal10@yahoo.com</a></p>
